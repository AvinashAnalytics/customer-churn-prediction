### **✨ Project Overview:**
Welcome to the **Customer Churn Analysis** project! 🧑‍💻 In this project, I worked as a **Data Analyst** and explored customer churn data for a fictional telecom company **Neo**. The goal was to analyze why customers were leaving and create predictive models that can help reduce churn. By performing data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning, I uncovered key insights to assist in improving customer retention.

🔍 **Techniques Used:**
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Predictive Modeling
- Model Evaluation

---

### **📂 Dataset:**
The **customer_churn** dataset contains important details about the customers:
- **`customerID`**: Unique identifier for each customer
- **`tenure`**: Months the customer has been with the company
- **`MonthlyCharges`**: Amount the customer is paying monthly
- **`PaymentMethod`**: The payment method used by the customer
- **`Contract`**: The contract type (e.g., One Year, Two Years)
- **`Churn`**: Whether the customer has churned ('Yes' or 'No')

---

### **🛠️ Tech Stack:**
- **Python 3.x** 🐍
- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn 📚
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda

---

### **📌 Key Tasks Performed:**

#### **1. Data Manipulation & Cleaning:**
- Extracted specific columns and cleaned the data 🧹
- Filtered customer segments:
  - Male senior citizens using electronic check payments 💳
  - Customers with tenure > 70 months or paying > $100 💸
  - Customers with two-year contracts, mailed check payments, and churn status 'Yes' 🔴

#### **2. Data Visualization:**
- Visualized customer behavior with various plots 📈:
  - **Bar Plot** for `InternetService` distribution 📊
  - **Histogram** for `Customer Tenure` 🏷️
  - **Scatter Plot** showing relationship between `MonthlyCharges` and `Tenure` 🔗
  - **Box Plot** to compare `Tenure` by `Contract` 🗂️

#### **3. Predictive Modeling:**
- Built machine learning models to predict churn 🔮:
  - **Linear Regression**: Predict `MonthlyCharges` based on `Tenure`
  - **Logistic Regression**: Predict churn using `MonthlyCharges`
  - **Decision Trees**: Model to predict churn based on `Tenure`
  - **Random Forest**: A more robust model using `Tenure` & `MonthlyCharges` 🌳

#### **4. Model Evaluation:**
- Evaluated model performance using:
  - **Confusion Matrix** and **Accuracy Score** 🔍
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** for regression models 📉

### **🏁 Conclusion:**
This project allowed me to gain valuable insights into customer churn and how predictive models can be used to reduce it. By analyzing customer data and building different machine learning models, I was able to uncover patterns that can guide business decisions to improve customer retention. 📊

The models I developed could be implemented by any telecom company to enhance customer experience and retention rates. This was an excellent learning experience and has greatly enhanced my skills in **Data Analysis** and **Machine Learning**! 🚀
